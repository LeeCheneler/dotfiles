Generate a world-class project-specific CLAUDE.md by deeply analyzing this
repository. The goal is to capture derived knowledge that saves Claude from
re-reading the entire project at the start of every session.

## Reading Order (highest signal first)

Work through these in order, reading the most information-dense sources first:

1. **README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md** — intent, setup instructions, conventions
2. **docs/decisions/, docs/adrs/** — architectural decisions and their context
3. **docs/*** — domain knowledge, architecture guides, API docs
4. **Package files** (package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, requirements.txt, etc.)
   — stack, scripts, dependencies
5. **Config files** (tsconfig, eslint/biome, prettier, terraform, docker, etc.)
   — coding standards already enforced by tooling
6. **CI/CD config** (.github/workflows/, Jenkinsfile, etc.) — what's tested,
   how it deploys
7. **Directory structure** (tree, 2 levels deep) — module layout, naming
8. **Key entrypoints** (main/index files, route definitions, handler files)
   — architecture in practice
9. **Test setup** (test config, a few example test files) — testing patterns,
   framework, structure, conventions

## Output

Create a CLAUDE.md at the project root with this structure:

```
<!-- Generated by /init-project on YYYY-MM-DD. Run /refresh-project to update. -->

# Project: <n>

## Overview
<What this project does, its purpose, key domain concepts. 2-3 sentences.>

## Stack
<Detected tech stack with versions where relevant. Be specific.>

## Key Commands
- **Install:** `<command>`
- **Build:** `<command>`
- **Test:** `<command>` (framework: <n>, location: <pattern>)
- **Lint:** `<command>`
- **Dev:** `<command>`
- **Deploy:** `<command or process description>`

## Architecture
<High-level description of how the project is structured — modules, layers,
data flow. Derived from directory structure and entrypoint analysis. Keep it
concise but complete enough that someone (or Claude) can orient quickly.>

## Conventions
<Detected patterns that must be followed: naming conventions, file structure,
import style, error handling approach, state management patterns, API patterns.
Be specific — "functions use camelCase, files use kebab-case, React components
use PascalCase" not "follow standard conventions".>

## Testing Patterns
<Test framework, assertion style, mocking approach (note: mock only at
boundaries), file naming (*.test.ts vs *.spec.ts), co-located vs separate,
any test utilities or helpers, how to run subsets of tests.>

## Key Decisions
<Summary of relevant ADRs or architectural decisions found in docs. Link to
the actual ADR files so they can be read in full if needed.>

## Gotchas
<Non-obvious things about this project — unusual patterns, things that look
wrong but are intentional, known sharp edges, common mistakes.>

## Notes
<Anything else relevant — deployment quirks, environment setup requirements,
external service dependencies, etc.>
```

Do NOT generate a thin, generic CLAUDE.md. Every section should contain
specific, actionable information derived from actually reading the codebase.
If a section has nothing meaningful to say, omit it rather than filling it
with generic advice.
